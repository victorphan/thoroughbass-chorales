{% newthought 'There is good reason' %} to believe, that C.P.E. Bach was responsible for most of the harmonization of all the sources, and that Niels Schiørring was mostly responsible for choosing and fitting the melodies. These include a Danish chorale book with figured bass, one chorale book realized for clavier, a 4 part vocal edition of the chorale book and an unpublished German chorale book, based on the Danish one, with figured bass + a litany, which was supposed to have been published together with the German chorale book.
